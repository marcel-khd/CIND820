# CIND820 D1H - Big Data Analytics Project - F2022

## Project Description
Recommender system for restaurants
User selects a "seed" restaurant, then the recommender system will produce top 10 recommendations based on similarity of their reviews to the reviews of the "seed" restaurant.

## Project Objectives
1. Come up with new recommendations that are not based on similarity to user's history or user's meta data to provide user with new and unexpected suggestions.
2. Ensure that the recommendations are similar enough to the chosen "seed" restaurant.

## Project Stages
1. Load Yelp dataset
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Data preparation and text preprocessing
4. Text tokenization and vectorization
5. Calculate recommendations
6. Evaluation
